## Repository Support

### Service Repositories

Service repositories typically contain microservices, APIs, or individual application components. These repositories require specific compliance considerations:

#### Characteristics
- **Smaller Codebase**: Focused on single service or component
- **Frequent Deployments**: Rapid release cycles with CI/CD integration
- **API-Focused**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, or gRPC services
- **Container-Based**: Docker images and Kubernetes deployments

#### Compliance Implementation

**1. Service-Specific Security Controls**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/service-compliance.yml
name: Service Repository Compliance

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  service-security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Container Security Scan
        uses: aquasec/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: '${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}'
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
          
      - name: API Security Testing
        run: |
          # OWASP ZAP API security testing
          docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw \
            -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-api-scan.py \
            -t /zap/wrk/api-definition.yaml \
            -f openapi \
            -r zap-api-report.html
            
      - name: Compliance Validation
        run: ./scripts/validate-service-compliance.sh
```

**2. API-Specific Compliance Checks**

              pip install detect-secrets
              ;;
            infrastructure)
              # Infrastructure as Code scanning
              curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/master/scripts/install_linux.sh | bash

        with:
          name: compliance-${{ matrix.scan-type }}-results
          path: compliance-reports/${{ matrix.scan-type }}/
```

**2. Module-Based Compliance Assessment**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/module-compliance-assessment.sh

# Identify application modules
MODULES=$(find . -name "pom.xml" -o -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" | xargs dirname | sort -u)

for module in $MODULES; do
    echo "Assessing compliance for module: $module"
    
    # Module-specific compliance checks
    ./scripts/assess-module-compliance.sh "$module"
    
    # Generate module compliance report
    ./scripts/generate-module-report.sh "$module"
done

# Aggregate module reports into comprehensive compliance report
./scripts/aggregate-compliance-reports.sh
```
